  ### Security

**Security?**
Security refers to safety, wellbeing, freedom and peace. It is the protection from dangers and threats to life and property.
Security is very important in the development and progress of every nation. Without security, it would be difficult for people to properly carry out their economic, social and political activities.

**Security education?**
Security education is the process of equipping students and other members of the society with the skills, awareness and knowledge required to prevent dangers to life and property. It also empowers us with information and skills to manage the consequences of dangers when they occur. Some of such dangers include crimes (theft, kidnapping, armed robbery, murder etc) as well as accidents and disasters.

***

### Importance of Security Education

Security Education is important of the following reasons:
i. it helps to protect lives and property in the society.

Internal aggression is attack from internal within the country while external aggression is attack from outside the country.
vi. it helps us in crime detection, that is, finding out crimes and people responsible for them.
vii. it equips us with defensive and life coping skills that make it possible to overcome and survive crime situations.

**Implications of Knowing Our Neighbours**
Knowing our neighbours has the following positive implications for security:
i. it will help in crime prevention.
ii. it will help communities to cooperate towards solving common security problems.
iii. it helps people living in neighbourhoods to understand and know themselves.
iv. it will help members of communities to detect strange movements.

### Neighbourhood Watch

It is an organized group of civil civilians set up to protect the security of lives and property within a neighbourhood. Neighbourhood watch is very important because it enables people contribute to solving their local security problems. Ensuring security of lives and property in our neighbourhoods should not be entirely left to the police and other security agencies.

**Functions of Neighbourhood watch**
i. Education: Neighbourhood Watch helps to educate people within its area of operation about security dangers and how to protect them.
ii. Reporting: Neighbourhood Watch collects useful information on security situations in their areas and reports it to the police and other law enforcement agencies.
iii. Arrest of suspected criminals: neighbourhood watch arrest suspected criminals and hands them over to the police.
v. Observation: neighbourhood watch observes the movement of neighbours and visitors in order to detect possible crimes.
vi. Assisting in investigation: neighbourhood watch helps the police and other security agencies investigating criminal activities in their areas.
vii. Keeping watch: They do this by patrolling their communities in order to identify possible criminal activities.

### Members of a Neighbourhood Watch: Ways of observing Movements in our Neighbourhood

i. Taking adequate notice of visitors: it is very important to take notice of visitors in our neighbourhood. taking note of their faces, overall physical appearance and behaviour would help in detecting suspects in case of crime as well noticing potential crimes.
ii. Knowing our neighbourhood: Knowing our neighbours would help a lot in observing and detecting criminal tendencies in our neighbourhoods. Name, occupation, and state of original origin are some of the important information we may require from our neighbours.
iii. Observing our neighbours' movements: this would help us detect and report potential criminal attributes of our neighbours.
iv. By use of telephone handset: using a telephone handset equipped with camera can assist in tracking down criminal suspects; we can either install the handset in a secret location to capture criminal activities or use it to secretly film criminal suspect.

***

### Suspicious Movement

**Topic:** Similarly, records of phones calls and text messages can be used to track criminals.
v. CCTV: (Closed Circuit Television (CCTV))

**Suspicious Movement**
These are strange and unusual movements liked to criminal activity. We should always endeavour to report suspicious movement when such is noticed.

**Examples of suspicious Movement**
i. A stranger walking round the house and peeping through the gates and windows.
ii. An adult trying to be unusually close to children.
iii. A stranger lurking, wandering and loitering around parked cars and peeping through the windows.
iv. A car repeatedly driving round a house or neighbourhood.
vii. A car consistently following another.
vii. Someone stalking you.

***

### Ways of Reporting Suspicious Movements in our Neighbourhoods

i. By reporting to parents: as children, any suspicious movements in our notice in our homes, schools, places of worship and other places should be reported to our parents, teachers or any trusted adult around us.
ii. Reporting to the police: suspicious movements in our neighbourhoods should be quickly reported to the nearest police station or security agency.
iii. By calling emergency numbers and hotlines: in the event of suspected criminal activity, we should call the police and other security agencies through their emergency numbers, also called hotlines.
iv. Website: the police and other security agents have websites where suspected criminal activities can be reported.
v. Text messages: apart from making phone calls, we can also send text messages to the phones of the police and other security agencies in case of crime, accident or any other emergency.

***

### Consequences of Failure to Observe and Report Suspicious Movement

1. Loss of property: any neighbourhood that fails to observe and report suspicious movement would most likely witness increase in theft leading to loss of money and valuable property.
2. Loss of life: murder, also called homicide is the killing of another person without justification. Failure to observe and report suspicious movement could lead to increase in the rate of murder.
3. Rape: Failure to observe and report suspicious movement would expose neighbourhoods to a high rate of rape which is the crime of having forced sex with someone.
4. Kidnapping: Kidnapping, also called abduction is the illegal seizure and detention of people by criminal elements. Kidnappers often demand ransom and other benefits before releasing their victims. Naturally, any society, community or neighbourhood that fails to observe and report suspicious movements would witness a high rate of kidnapping.
5. Infiltration of criminals: if we fail to report insecurity, criminals will easily infiltrate our neighbourhoods.
6. Increase in crime rate: The uncontrolled infiltration of criminals in our neighbourhoods would lead to general increase in the rate of criminal activities. In other words, apart from murder and kidnapping other crimes as such as armed robbery, burglary and theft would be on the increase.
7. General feeling of insecurity: The increase in crime as a result of failure to report suspicious movement would lead to general feeling of insecurity. In other words, people would live in fear.

### Objects of Security Alert Gadgets

These refer to objects used to attract attention and raise alarm in case of security danger. Whistles, drums, horns and gong are examples of objects of security alert.
The objects of security alert are explained as follows:
1. Whistle: This a very important object of security alert. A person in danger can blow a whistle to alert people. Security agents also use whistles to communicate among themselves.
2. Drums: drums can also be used to alert security and the public to security dangers. The use of drums is a traditional method of security alert.
3. Horn: blowing horns helps to attract attention to suspicious movement and other dangerous situations.
4. Gong: gongs are also used to alert people to security dangers. This is common in rural communities.
5. Bell: Like horns, drums and whistles, bells are used to strike a note of warning when there is security danger.
6. Fire: bonfires especially in rural communities provide light which would assist in detecting suspicious movement and possible criminal activity. Bonfires also help to scare away dangerous animals. Similarly, they help to scare away criminals by letting them know that eyes are on them.
7. Torch light: security agents use torchlight to give and receive signals especially at night.
8. Dogs: it is said that dog is a man's best friend. By barking, dogs help to alert people to suspicious movement and appearance of strange faces in neighbourhoods. Trained dogs also help to detect banned drugs, weapons and other illegal items.
9. CCTV: CCTV stands for Closed Circuit Television. They help to capture strange movement and criminal activities through cameras.
10. Electronic alarm systems: electrical alarm systems placed at homes, in vehicles, offices and other places help to alert people to dangers.
