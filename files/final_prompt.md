*** CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR END OF TERM QUIZ ***
This is an END OF TERM quiz, which means ALL THREE SECTIONS (A, B, AND C) are MANDATORY and MUST be included.
DO NOT skip Section B or Section C under any circumstances.
*** END OF CRITICAL REQUIREMENT ***

Each section should be an array of strings containing the questions for that section.

Section A should contain objective questions (multiple choice).
Section B should contain short answer questions.
Section C should contain essay/theory questions.
IMPORTANT: Provide answers for all questions in each section in the corresponding answers_A, answers_B, and answers_C arrays.

Format requirements:

# For Section A (objective questions):
- Never end a question with a full stop
- A question may end with question mark
- Use 1 underscore (_) for blanks
- Never end a question with a blank
- Use brackets for options (e.g., (a)...(b)...(c)...) and place questions and options on same line
- Fix bad questions by removing or replacing options to ensure one correct answer
- For answers_A, provide only the letter of the correct option (a, b, c, etc.) or the word that fills the blank

- 
Each question must:
– Be closed-ended (True/False or Multiple Choice)
– Ask for a very simple fact or basic concept
– Use extremely simple words and grammar
– Require one-word or short-phrase answers


# For Section B (short answer questions):
- Use 9 underscores (_________) for blanks
- For answers_B, provide concise answers

- 
Each question should:
– Ask for a specific fact (e.g. person, name, object, place, event)
– Require a short answer (1–3 words)
– Be written in plain language (avoid complex phrasing)
– Avoid “why”, “how”, or any question that needs explanation or opinion
– Focus on basic recall, not reasoning or values

Do not include:
– Definitions
– Moral judgments
– Personal views or behavior-based questions
– Multi-part questions


# For Section C (essay questions):
- Make questions clear and concise
- Maintain academic language level
- For answers_C, provide brief model answers or key points

- Create simple questions. Each question should ask for a basic fact and require a short, direct answer (like one word or a short phrase). Use only clear, simple language. Avoid explanation or reasoning.

# For Math quizzes specifically:
- Always use perfect Unicode for any math sums, fractions, or symbols (e.g., ½, ¾, ², ³, ×, ÷, ±, ≤, ≥, π, ∞)
- Let all fractions always use Unicode creatively in the best way possible (prefer ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙, ⅛, ⅔, ¾, ⅖, ⅗, ⅘, ⅚, ⅝, ⅞ over 1/2, 1/3, etc.)
- For math questions that are sum gaps (e.g., 6 times what equals 18), write as: 6 × _ = 18
- Use × as multiplication symbol instead of * in displayed questions
- Think deeply about math questions and math sums when making math quizzes
- Let the questions be very very easy, using very simple, easy language, for 6 year olds
- Use proper mathematical notation and Unicode symbols throughout

let the questions be numbered.
refrain from mentioning or referencing the source text that the quiz is made from. Never say something like "according to the text" or "from the text"
A section may have subsections, which may have headings, stories or instructions for the questions that follow perhaps, or passages, or just such parts that are not really questions in themselves, e.g "Write the short form of the following words" or "<a story required for the questions in this section to be answered>". Add such parts or subheadings or stories or instruction as unnumbered questions.
MANDATORY: Let section A contain exactly 50 objective questions. Let section B contain exactly 5 short-answer questions. Let section C contain exactly 5 essay/theory questions.

    CRITICAL: For END OF TERM quizzes, sections B and C are REQUIRED and must ALWAYS be included regardless of grade level or any other factors.
    
    CRITICAL: Make the word problems in the objective section to be only 7 in number
