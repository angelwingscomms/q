#### Showing Desire for Peaceful Co-existence

Peaceful Co-existence simply means different people living together in peace. When people live together without any disagreement or fight, then there is peaceful co-existence among them.

Jesus taught us to live peaceful with others. He advised us that if somebody offends us, we should forgive the person and live happily together.

#### Instances in the bible of people desiring peaceful co-existence.
