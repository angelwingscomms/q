*** CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR END OF TERM QUIZ ***
This is an END OF TERM quiz, which means ALL THREE SECTIONS (A, B, AND C) are MANDATORY and MUST be included.
DO NOT skip Section B or Section C under any circumstances.
*** END OF CRITICAL REQUIREMENT ***

Each section should be an array of strings containing the questions for that section.

Section A should contain objective questions (multiple choice).
Section B should contain short answer questions.
Section C should contain essay/theory questions.
IMPORTANT: Provide answers for all questions in each section in the corresponding answers_A, answers_B, and answers_C arrays.

Format requirements:

# For Section A (objective questions):
- Never end with a full stop
- Use 1 underscore (_) for blanks
- Never end a question with a blank
- Use brackets for options (e.g., (a)...(b)...(c)...) and place questions and options on same line
- Fix bad questions by removing or replacing options to ensure one correct answer
- Questions may end with question marks
- For answers_A, provide only the letter of the correct option (a, b, c, etc.) or the word that fills the blank

- 
Each question must:
– Be closed-ended (True/False or Multiple Choice)
– Ask for a very simple fact or basic concept
– Use extremely simple words and grammar
– Require one-word or short-phrase answers


# For Section B (short answer questions):
- Use 9 underscores (_________) for blanks
- For answers_B, provide concise answers

- 
Each question should:
– Ask for a specific fact (e.g. person, name, object, place, event)
– Require a short answer (1–3 words)
– Be written in plain language (avoid complex phrasing)
– Avoid “why”, “how”, or any question that needs explanation or opinion
– Focus on basic recall, not reasoning or values

Do not include:
– Definitions
– Moral judgments
– Personal views or behavior-based questions
– Multi-part questions


# For Section C (essay questions):
- Make questions clear and concise
- Maintain academic language level
- For answers_C, provide brief model answers or key points

- Create simple questions. Each question should ask for a basic fact and require a short, direct answer (like one word or a short phrase). Use only clear, simple language. Avoid explanation or reasoning.

# For Math quizzes specifically:
- Always use perfect Unicode for any math sums, fractions, or symbols (e.g., ½, ¾, ², ³, ×, ÷, ±, ≤, ≥, π, ∞)
- Let all fractions always use Unicode creatively in the best way possible (prefer ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅕, ⅙, ⅛, ⅔, ¾, ⅖, ⅗, ⅘, ⅚, ⅝, ⅞ over 1/2, 1/3, etc.)
- For math questions that are sum gaps (e.g., 6 times what equals 18), write as: 6 × _ = 18
- Use × as multiplication symbol instead of * in displayed questions
- Think deeply about math questions and math sums when making math quizzes
- Let the questions be very very easy, using very simple, easy language, for 6 year olds
- Use proper mathematical notation and Unicode symbols throughout

let the questions be numbered.
refrain from mentioning or referencing the source text that the quiz is made from. Never say something like "according to the text" or "from the text"
A section may have subsections, which may have headings, stories or instructions for the questions that follow perhaps, or passages, or just such parts that are not really questions in themselves, e.g "Write the short form of the following words" or "<a story required for the questions in this section to be answered>". Add such parts or subheadings or stories or instruction as unnumbered questions.
MANDATORY: Let section A contain exactly 20 objective questions. Let section B contain exactly 5 short-answer questions. Let section C contain exactly 5 essay/theory questions.

    CRITICAL: For END OF TERM quizzes, sections B and C are REQUIRED and must ALWAYS be included regardless of grade level or any other factors.

Foreword
Our country's future lies in the education of our children. The Government of Sierra Leone is
committed to doing whatever it takes to secure this future.
As Minister of Education, Science and Technology since 2007, I have worked every day to improve
our country's education. We have faced challenges, not least the Ebola epidemic which as we all
know hit our sector hard. The Government's response to this crisis – led by our President - showed
first-hand how we acted decisively in the face of those challenges, to make things better than they
were in the first place.
One great success in our response was the publication of the Accelerated Teaching Syllabi in August
2015. This gave teachers the tools they needed to make up for lost time whilst ensuring pupils
received an adequate level of knowledge across each part of the curriculum. The Accelerated
Teaching syllabi also provided the pedagogical resource and impetus for the successful national
radio and TV teaching programs during the Ebola epidemic.
It is now time to build on this success. I am pleased to issue new lesson plans across all primary and
JSS school grades in Language Arts and Mathematics. These plans give teachers the support they
need to cover each element of the national curriculum. In total, we are producing 2,700 lesson plans
one for each lesson, in each term, in each year for each class. This is a remarkable achievement in a
matter of months.
These plans have been written by experienced Sierra Leonean educators together with international
experts. They have been reviewed by officials of my Ministry to ensure they meet the specific needs
of the Sierra Leonean population. They provide step-by-step guidance for each learning outcome,
using a range of recognised techniques to deliver the best teaching.
I call on all teachers and heads of schools across the country to make best use of these materials. We
are supporting our teachers through a detailed training programme designed specifically for these
new plans. It is really important that these Lesson Plans are used, together with any other materials
you may have.
This is just the start of education transformation in Sierra Leone. I am committed to continue to
strive for the changes that will make our country stronger.
I want to thank our partners for their continued support. Finally, I also want to thank you – the
teachers of our country - for your hard work in securing our future.

2. Ask: What can we do if we don't have counters or our chart? (Answer: Use mental maths.)
3. Say: We can use mental maths.
4. Say: Mental maths is when you use your brain to solve maths problems without the help of
other tools.
Introduction to the New Material (8 minutes)
1. Say: We will start using mental maths with our 5s.
2. Say: We have practised multiplying the number 5 by various numbers in our past few lessons, so
we are familiar with the answer to certain equations.
3. Say: For example, we know that 5 x 2 = 10. To solve this equation we just need to add 5 + 5, or
we can memorize the answer.
4. Say: But what if we have not memorized the answer to the equations? How can we solve the
problems?
5. Say: We can count by 5s in our head.
6. Say: For example, if we have the equation 5 x 4, we can count in our heads: 5, 10, 15, 20. Then
we have the answer 20.
7. Say: Let's say the equation is 5 x 8. We can count up in our heads: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 25, 40
Guided Practice (8 minutes)

8. Say: The big hand is pointing to the 12.
9. Say: Whenever the big hand is pointing exactly to the 12, it tells us we are exactly on an hour, so
we look at the little hand to see what number it is pointing to.
10. Say: Since the little hand is on the 3, we know that the time is 3 o'clock.
11. Erase the little hand on the 3 and draw it pointing to the 7.
12. Say: The big hand is still pointing exactly to the 12 and the little hand is pointing to the 7. The
clock says it is now 7 o'clock.
13. Erase the big hand and draw it pointing to the 6. Erase the small hand and draw it halfway
between the 7 and the 8. It should look like this:

14. Say: I have now moved the big hand, and it is pointing directly at the 6. When the big hand is
pointing to the 6, it now tells us we are on a half hour.
15. Say: You will see that the small hand is no longer exactly on the 7 but is halfway to the 8. The
time still starts with 7 because we are not at 8 yet.
16. Say: When we read the clock we start with the minutes, which in this case is half. Then we add
the hour, which is 7. So the clock says half past 7.
17. Erase the short hand and draw it halfway between the 9 and the 10.
18. Say: Now the clock says half past 9.
