The ancient Iroko tree stood majestically in the village square. Its massive branches spread wide like a chief's welcoming embrace. Weaver birds built their intricate nests in its leaves, their cheerful chirps filling the air all day long. A small stream, 'Odo-Aro', flowed gently nearby, its water cool and clear. Children from the village often gathered under the Iroko, sharing tales and laughter. They etched their names into its rugged bark, marking their childhood memories over many seasons. The Iroko was a silent witness to countless sunny market days and moonlit nights, a true guardian of the community.
