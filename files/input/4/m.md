TOPIC
AREA (Pg 220) [Area of rectangles, squares, Word problems in areas]
- Meaning of area and units for measuring areas.
* Area of rectangle, Square and circle
Definition:
Area is the amount of space inside a shape. Imagine you have a piece of paper and you draw a rectangle on it. The area is the amount of space inside that rectangle.

Units of Area:
Area is measured in Square units, such as:
① Square centimeters (cm²)
② Square meters (m²)
③ Square kilometers (km²)

Examples
1. A piece of paper might have an area of 100cm².
2. A room might have an area of 20m².
3. A park might have an area of 1km².

Area of plane shapes by Calculation
To find area by counting Squares Could take a long time especially if you have to find the area of a large surface. There is a formula to Calculate the area of a rectangle or a square.

Examples:
1. Calculate the area of the shape below:
[Rectangle with sides 5cm and 3cm]
Length = 5cm
Breadth = 3cm
Area of rectangle: Length x Breadth
Area = 5cm x 3 cm = 15cm²

② Calculate the area of the shape below:
[Square with side 4cm]
Length = 4cm
Breadth = 4cm
Area = (4 x 4)cm² = 16cm²

[Boxed: Area of rectangle]
Class Fun [pg 222, Ex1, A 1&2, B 1&2]
A
① [Rectangle with sides 8cm and 3cm] A=LxB = (8x3)cm²=24cm²
② [Rectangle with sides 7cm and 4cm] A=LxB = (7x4)cm² = 28cm²

---
**Page 3**

(Area of square)
B. [Square with side 5cm], A = L² = (5x5)cm² = 25cm²
[Square with side 3cm], A = L² = (3x3)cm² = 9cm²

Home Fun [Pg 222, Ex.2 (1-5)]
① A = 4cm x 7cm = 28cm² ② A= 8cm x 9cm = 72cm²
③ A = 6m x 22m = 132m² ④ A=11cm x 8cm = 88cm²
⑤ A = 12cm x 3cm = 36cm²

Examples:
Finding either the length or breadth of a rectangle, you simply divide the given area by either the breadth or the length.
① [Rectangle with A=12cm², L=4cm, B=3cm]
Breadth = 12cm²/4 = 3cm
② [Rectangle with A=21cm², B=3cm]
Area = 21cm² Breadth=3cm
Length = 21/3 = 7cm

Class Work [Pg 223, Ex 3, 1-5]
① B = A/L = 48/6 = 8cm ② L = A/B = 12/2 = 6cm ③ L = A/B = 36/6 = 6cm
④ L = A/B = 20/4 = 5cm ⑤ B = A/L = 100/10 = 10cm

To find the side of a square when only the area is given, simply work out the square root of the area.
Side of a square = √Area

Example
① Given the area of a square as 121cm². Calculate the length of its side.
Solution
[Square with A=121cm²] A=L² => L=√A = √121 = 11cm

② Calculate the length of a square whose area is 9cm².
Solution
[Square with A=9cm²] A=L² => L=√A = √9 = 3cm

Home Fun [Pg 223, Ex 4, 1-5]
① Area=100cm², side of the square L=√100 = 10cm
② Area=49cm², side " ; L=√49 = 7cm
③ A=64cm², L=√64 = 8cm
⑤ A=36cm², L=√36 = 6cm
④ A=144cm², L=√144 = 12cm

Finding the areas of irregular plane shapes.
To find the areas of irregular shapes which might look complex at a glance, we just make them regular to look like rectangles or squares.
Example: Find the area of the shape below.
[Irregular L-shaped figure divided into A and B. Dimensions: 2cm top, 5cm left side, 3cm bottom, 3cm right side with an inner corner]
Area of shape A = 2x5cm² = 10cm²
" " " B=1x3cm² = 3cm²
" " whole shape = (10+3)cm² = 13cm²

To find the area, follow these steps:
① Divide the shape into regular shapes using dotted lines.
② Calculate the missing sides and write them down.
③ Using letters label each shape.
④ Calculate the area of each shape.
⑤ Add all the areas to find the area of the irregular shape.

WEEK 2
SUB-TOPIC: AREA [Pg 225]
AREA OF FARMLAND, TOWNS AND CITIES
The square metre is too small to measure very large areas such as States, countries e.t.c.
The area of Nigeria in square metres is 923,768,000,000 m².
The number of digits are reduced when we use acre and it is reduced further when we use hectare. The acre is 4000m² and it is more convenient for measuring fields but the most common units are the hectare and square kilometre.
1 acre = 4000m², 1 hectare = 2½ acres = 10,000m²
1 square kilometre = 1,000,000m² = 100 hectares

Example:
Convert 2 hectares to acres.
Solution
1 hectare = 2½ acres
2 hectares = 2 x 5/2 = 5
∴ 2 hectares = 5 acres

Class Fun
Pg 225, Ex. 1 A 1-5
Solution
① In acres:
Area of Nigeria = 923,768,000,000 m²
1 acre = 4000 m²
x = 923,768,000,000 m²
Cross multiply
4000x = 923,768,000,000
x = 923,768,000,000 / 4,000 = 230,942,000 acres

② In hectares:
1 hectare = 10,000 m²
x = 923,768,000,000 m²
Cross multiply,
10,000x = 923,768,000,000
x = 923,768,000,000 / 10,000 = 92,376,800 hectares

③ In square kilometres
1km² = 1,000,000 m²
x = 923,768,000,000 m²
x = 923,768,000,000 / 1,000,000 = 923,768 km²

Topic: Capacity (Pg 228)
Capacity is the measure of the amount of liquid in a container. The standard unit of measuring capacity is the litre (l).
Small amount of liquid is measured in millilitre (ml) while large amount is measured in litres.

Table of Capacity measure
10 millilitres (ml) = 1 Centilitre (cl) | 10 litres = 1 decalitre (dal)
10 centilitres = 1 decilitre (dl) | 10 decalitres = 1 hectolitre (hl)
10 decilitres = 1 litre (l) | 10 hectolitres = 1 kilolitre (kl)

Note that
1000ml = 1 litre (l) 100cl = 1 litre 1000l = 1 kilolitre (kl)
* When converting a smaller capacity measure to a higher one, note the following:

---
**Page 14**

a) From ml to cl, divide by 10. c) From ml to l, divide by 1000.
b) From cl to l, divide by 100. d) From l to kl, divide by 1000.

Examples:
① Convert 4000ml to l = 4000/1000 = 4l
② Convert 600cl to l = 600/100 = 6l

Ex. 1 CLASS FUN [Pg 228, 1-5]

③ 650cl = 650/100 = 6.5l ④ 8100cl = 8100/100 = 81l
⑤ 5000ml = 5000/1000 = 5l

⑩ 10,500ml = 10,500/1000 = 10.5l

---
**Page 15**

When converting higher capacity measure to a smaller capacity, note the following:
a) From cl to ml, multiply by 10. c) From l to ml, multiply by 1000.
b) From l to cl, multiply by 100. d) From kl to l, multiply by 1000.

Class Fun [Pg 247, Ex. A, 2-6] Note: No. 1 has been solved.
② ½ right angles = North East (NE)
③ 2 right angles = South ④ 3 right angles = West
⑤ 2½ right angles = South West
⑥ 3½ right angles = North West

Home Fun [pg 247, Ex. B, 1-5]
① Two angles (from North, turn clockwisely to face South)
② 1½ (West and turn clockwise to face North East)
③ 2½ (South and turn clockwise to face North East)
④ 3 right angles (North and turn anti clockwise to face East).
⑤ 2¾ " " (North and turn anti clockwise to face South East)

Topic: Three-dimensional Shapes
Definition:
A 3-dimensional shape is a solid object that has length, width and depth. It takes up space and has volume, allowing it to be measured in three dimensions. Examples include cubes, spheres, pyramids and more.

Properties of a Cube and a Cuboid
CUBE
A Cube has:
- 8 Vertices
- 12 equal edges
- 6 equal faces
[Diagram of a cube with Edge and Face labeled]

CUBOID
A cuboid has:
- 8 Vertices
- 12 unequal edges
- 6 " faces

Topic: Everyday Statistics
Definition:
Statistics is a way of collecting, organizing and understanding data (information) to answer questions or solve problems. It involves:
① Gathering data (Collecting information)
② Organizing data (Using tables, charts, graphs)
③ Analyzing data (finding patterns, averages, comparisons).

Example:
A) The pictures in the graph show the number of Shapes in Grade 4 Shape Corner.
[Bar chart with pictures inside the bars]
Title: Shapes
X-axis: Triangle, Circle, Square, Rhombus
Y-axis label: Number of Shapes
- Triangle bar: contains 5 Δ symbols.
- Circle bar: contains 4 O symbols.
- Square bar: contains 6 □ symbols.
- Rhombus bar: contains 4 ◊ symbols.
Note: Each square stands for 5 shapes.
