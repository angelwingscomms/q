### Security

**Security?**
Security refers to safety, wellbeing, freedom and peace. It is the protection from dangers and threats to life and property.
Security is very important in the development and progress of every nation. Without security, it would be difficult for people to properly carry out their economic, social and political activities.

**Security education?**
Security education is the process of equipping students and other members of the society with the skills, awareness and knowledge required to prevent dangers to life and property. It also empowers us with information and skills to manage the consequences of dangers when they occur. Some of such dangers include crimes (theft, kidnapping, armed robbery, murder etc) as well as accidents and disasters.

### Members of a Neighbourhood Watch: Ways of observing Movements in our Neighbourhood

i. Taking adequate notice of visitors: it is very important to take notice of visitors in our neighbourhood. taking note of their faces, overall physical appearance and behaviour would help in detecting suspects in case of crime as well noticing potential crimes.
ii. Knowing our neighbourhood: Knowing our neighbours would help a lot in observing and detecting criminal tendencies in our neighbourhoods. Name, occupation, and state of original origin are some of the important information we may require from our neighbours.
iii. Observing our neighbours' movements: this would help us detect and report potential criminal attributes of our neighbours.
iv. By use of telephone handset: using a telephone handset equipped with camera can assist in tracking down criminal suspects; we can either install the handset in a secret location to capture criminal activities or use it to secretly film criminal suspect.

### Suspicious Movement

**Topic:** Similarly, records of phones calls and text messages can be used to track criminals.
v. CCTV: (Closed Circuit Television (CCTV))

**Suspicious Movement**
These are strange and unusual movements liked to criminal activity. We should always endeavour to report suspicious movement when such is noticed.

**Examples of suspicious Movement**

### Ways of Reporting Suspicious Movements in our Neighbourhoods

i. By reporting to parents: as children, any suspicious movements in our notice in our homes, schools, places of worship and other places should be reported to our parents, teachers or any trusted adult around us.
ii. Reporting to the police: suspicious movements in our neighbourhoods should be quickly reported to the nearest police station or security agency.
iii. By calling emergency numbers and hotlines: in the event of suspected criminal activity, we should call the police and other security agencies through their emergency numbers, also called hotlines.
iv. Website: the police and other security agents have websites where suspected criminal activities can be reported.

### Consequences of Failure to Observe and Report Suspicious Movement

1. Loss of property: any neighbourhood that fails to observe and report suspicious movement would most likely witness increase in theft leading to loss of money and valuable property.
2. Loss of life: murder, also called homicide is the killing of another person without justification. Failure to observe and report suspicious movement could lead to increase in the rate of murder.
3. Rape: Failure to observe and report suspicious movement would expose neighbourhoods to a high rate of rape which is the crime of having forced sex with someone.
4. Kidnapping: Kidnapping, also called abduction is the illegal seizure and detention of people by criminal elements. Kidnappers often demand ransom and other benefits before releasing their victims. Naturally, any society, community or neighbourhood that fails to observe and report suspicious movements would witness a high rate of kidnapping.
5. Infiltration of criminals: if we fail to report insecurity, criminals will easily infiltrate our neighbourhoods.
6. Increase in crime rate: The uncontrolled infiltration of criminals in our neighbourhoods would lead to general increase in the rate of criminal activities. In other words, apart from murder and kidnapping other crimes as such as armed robbery, burglary and theft would be on the increase.
7. General feeling of insecurity: The increase in crime as a result of failure to report suspicious movement would lead to general feeling of insecurity. In other words, people would live in fear.
