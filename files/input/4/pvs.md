### **WEEK 2: Simple farm tools**

**FARM'S TOPIC TODAY IS SIMPLE FARM TOOL**
Simple farm tools are tools or simple machines that are used on the farm to make it easier for farmers to use. There are many tools used on farms that are not "farm only" or that is assigned to a particular use like that of shovels, brooms, rakes etc but they have their own place on farms. They can be used easily by peasant farmers to produce food crops such as rice, beans, that can be eaten by the family and not for sell.

Farm tools are simple or small equipment operated by hand to carry out agricultural activities. The farm tools we are referring to are the ones that are powered by human energy and muscle.

### **WEEK 4&5: Description of Simple farm tools**

Farm tools are instruments we use in the farm to aid us in farm work, thereby making it easy. Such equipments include cutlass, wheel barrow, hoe, shovel and axe.

**DESCRIPTION OF SIMPLE FARM TOOLS**

*   **PICK AXE:** The pick axe is made up of a long wooden handle with a double headed thick metal blade that is attached to the handle through a loop. The head of the pick axe is made up of two edges, one part of the end of the blade is pointed, while the other end is flat and sharp edged. They are mainly used for breaking up of hard soil, and digging up of roots and tree stumps.

*   **HAND FORK:** When it is viewed, the hand fork, looks like the kitchen fork we eat with, just that it is a little bit bigger, it has a short wooden or metal handle with four prongs. It is used in mixing manure into the soil, for breaking the surface of the soil, so that air and water, can pass easily and it is also used for the removal of weeds on the seed bed.

*   **HAND TROWEL:** It is boat shaped or it is either curved sloop metal blade that is attached to a short wooden or metal handle. When using it, you hold it with one hand. It helps in the transplanting of seedlings, for the application of fertilizer and also for the application of manure to the soil, it helps in loosening vegetable beds, it can also be used for light weeding, sampling or mixing up of soil and digging holes for the planting of seeds.

*   **THE SICKLE:** The sickle has a curved metal blade that is fitted into a short wooden handle. The inner part of the curved metal blade is very sharp while the other part, has a blunt edge. To recognise a sickle when been viewed, it has a structure like that of a question mark (?). It used in the plucking of fruits. This can only be possible, when it is tied to a long handle, it can also be used to harvest cereals like rice, wheat barley because they possess thin stems. It can also be used in the harvest of grasses.

*   **THE HAMMER:** It is made up of a thick heavy metal head that is fitted into a straight wooden or metal handle. At the end of the thick heavy metal there is a prong which is used for the removal of nails. The hammer can be used for driving nails into wooden structures whether in the farm or at home, it can also be used to straighten damaged or bent components of either farm implements or our home furnitures. It can also be used in the removal of nails from wood.

*   **THE MALLET:** It is made up of a large head with a wooden handle that is similar to that of a hammer. The entire body is made up of wood. It is solely used for the hitting of woods like pegs, so that they would not be damaged in the process, when they are been hit into the ground.

*   **SECATEURS:** The secateurs are made up of two metal blades of which one has a concave curve while the other has a convex curve that are joined together at a point. It has two short metal handles with a spring in between them when handling it; you handle with one hand, while the plant branch to be cut is held with the other free hand. To recognise the secateurs it looks like a pair of scissors. It is used for trimming flowers and the pruning of the branches of shrubs and trees.

*   **THE SHEARS:** It is seen as a pair of an enlarged pair of scissors with two long blades, connected at a appoint by a bolt and a nut of which the blades are sharpened at one edge not the two sides in other not to injure some one. The handle of the shears may be made of wood, metal, plastic or rubber. It is usually handled with both hands. Shears are used to prune down trees or branches of shrubs, trimming of hedges and trimming of Ornamental plants used in house decoration.

*   **WATERING CAN:** It is made up of galvanized iron which prevents it from rusting. Some are also made of very synthetic rubber. The watering can is made up of a tank, a handle and a spout. This spout is long with a perforated metal sheet over its mouth which is referred to as the ROSE, but in case of the rubber made watering can the mouth is covered by a rubber. It is used to apply water to crops like seedlings in a nursery and vegetables. Some times it is used in applying liquid fertilizers to crops as well as the watering of cement blocks used for the constructions of structures and buildings.

*   **CUTLASS:** The cutlass is one of the commonest used farm tools in Nigeria. They come in various shapes and sizes. It is a flat long metal blade with a short wooden or plastic handle with one edge sharp while the other is blunt. They perform many functions. It is used for the clearing of bushes around your homes, for the felling of big trees. It is used in harvesting crops like sugar cane, maize, cassava, yam and palm nut fruits. It is also used in the planting of melon during the planting season, cutlass can also be used for the transplanting of seedlings, weeding of crops, both in the digging of shallow holes and used in the trimming and pruning of flowers.

*   **THE HOE:** Hoe comes in different types, which are used in Nigeria today. There is the West African hoe and the Indian hoe. They both have metal blades with a wooden or metal blades. Hoes are used in tilling the soil, harvesting of crops like cassava, sweet potato and cocoyam, weeding between the rows of crops, digging of drains, making trenches and foundation of farm houses, and the making of ridges and mounds. The West African hoe is made of short curve handle while the Indian hoe has a long handle. The West African hoe has a round metal blade while the Indian hoe has a rectangular metal blade. The blade (metal) is attached to the handle with a prong while that of the Indian hoe is attached to the handle with a hoop.

*   **THE SPADE:** The spade is made up of a long rectangular flat blade which is attached to a fairly long cylindrical handle that widens at the posterior end to form a triangular block with a D-shaped whole for hand when used. Spade is used for different proposes. It can be used for digging of holes and trenches around us, for leveling the ground, for making seedbeds, ridges, mounds and heaps, transplanting of seedlings like palm oil seedlings, turning the soil and the mixing of manures, light weeding in the farm and at home, mixing of cement and concrete for farm and home structures and the digging of foundations when constructing farm and home buildings.

### **WEEK 6: Description of animal farm tools**

*   **Drinking trough:** it is a container made of plastic Or metal.
*   **Feeding trough:** it is also a container made of plastic or metal.
*   **Fishing net:** this is made of woven ropes: There are scoop net, gills net and cast net.
*   **Battery cage:** it is made of metal with several partitions with feeding and drinking troughs attached to it. Etc.

### **WEEK 8&9: Maintenance of farm and animal tools**

**MAINTENANCE OF FARM AND ANIMAL TOOLS**
The following are ways we can care and maintain crop and animal farm tools in order for them to work effectively and prevent them from getting damaged.
1.  Clean the tools after use by washing and drying them under the sun or in a cool place.
2.  Use the tools for the purpose for which they are made.
3.  Store tools cleaned, in a safe and dry place after use.
4.  Sharpen the tools in a termite free area.
5.  Repair all broken or damaged parts.
6.  Oil and grease or lubricate moveable parts of the tools to reduce friction.
7.  Keep records of the movement of farm tools.
8.  Do not store in head pans and watering cans place upside down after use to ensure proper drying.
9.  Do not leave tools with sharp parts carelessly around.
10. Do not allow children to play with tools.

**REASONS FOR MAINTAINING AND CARING FOR FARM TOOLS**
*   To increase durability
*   To increase efficiency
*   Reduce cost of replacement
*   For safety of the user/avoid accidents.
*   Avoid damage to the tools.

**CONTROL MEASURES OF FARM AND ANIMALS TOOLS**
*   **Biological control measures:** since some of the farm tools parts are made of wood and some insect, bacterial, termite attack wood. Such tool can be maintained by using bio control agent to prevent wood decainfection by using antifungal antibiotics like actinomycetes and streptomyces.
*   **Cultural control measures:** is done by ensuring all farm tool are clean and kept in the right place after use to prevent damages and accident.
*   **Chemical control measures:** chemical preventive methods are used on farm tools to prevent them from decaying and rusting by applying chemical during or after production of the farm tools. Like applying paint on some part of the farm tools to prevent it from rusting.

### **WEEK 10&11: WEED**

**Description of a Weed**
There are numerous definitions of a weed, including:
*   a plant out of place and not intentionally sown
*   a plant growing where it is not wanted
*   a plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered. (R.W.Emerson)
*   plants that are competitive, persistent, pernicious, and interfere negatively with human activity (Ross, et. al.)

**Cultural weed control** – One of the easiest ways to control weeds is through prevention or cultural control. Close planting in the garden can reduce weed growth by eliminating open space. Cover crops are good for this as well. Adding mulch will prevent light from getting to weed seeds and prevents growth.

**Mechanical weed control** – Mechanical control of common weed plants can be accomplished through hand pulling, hoeing, digging or mowing (which slows growth and reduces seed formation). While these methods are effective, they can be time consuming.

**Chemical weed control**

**Characteristics of weeds**
Certain characteristics are associated with and allow the survival of weeds. Weeds posses one or more of the following:
a) abundant seed production;
b) rapid population establishment;
c) seed dormancy;
d) long-term survival of buried seed;
e) adaptation for spread;
f) presence of vegetative reproductive structures; and
g) ability to occupy sites disturbed by human activities.

Weeds are troublesome in many ways. Primarily, they reduce crop yield by competing for water, light, soil nutrients, and space. Other problems associated with weeds in agriculture include:
a) reduced crop quality by contaminating the commodity;
b) interference with harvest;
c) serve as hosts for crop diseases or provide shelter for insects to overwinter;
d) limit the choice of crop rotation sequences and cultural practices; and
e) production of chemical substances which are toxic to crop plants (allelopathy), animals, or humans.
