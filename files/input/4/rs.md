### **WEEK 2: God’s ways of showing love to his people**

The love of God to his people is shown through many way. He provides such needs as food, shelter/house and clothes for his children. He makes the sun to shine both on the good and on evil people. God also sends rain on both the just and the unjust. It is the love of God that brings sinners to repentance.

The love of God for the world made him to send his only begotten son, Jesus, into the world to perform different miracles, signs and wonders. Jesus had pity on the sick, lame, blind, and many who had any need. He gave hope to the hopeless and life to the lifeless. Jesus was nailed to the cross and died for the sins of the people. He shed his blood for the forgiveness of sins. Jesus told us that we should love one another and be perfect as our heavenly father is perfect.

### **WEEK 3: Instances of how Jesus demonstrated his love to people**

There are many instances in the Bible when Jesus demonstrated his love to people. Examples are:

**a) Blind Bartimeaus**
One day, Jesus came to Jericho. As he was leaving, the disciples and many people followed him. Bartimeaus, a blind beggar and son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. When he heard that Jesus was passing by, he cried out to Jesus for help. He said, ‘Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me’. He did not stop shouting out until Jesus heard him and stopped. Jesus sent for him. As he was coming, he threw away his garment. When he got to Jesus, Jesus asked him, ‘What do you want me to do for you’? The blind man answered, ‘Master, let me receive my sight’. Jesus replied him, ‘Go your way; your faith has made you well’. Immediately, the blind man received his sight and followed Jesus.

**b) Zacchaeus**
Zacchaeus was a chief tax collector and a rich man. One day, Jesus was passing through Jericho. As usual, many people followed him. Zacchaeus wanted to see Jesus but because he was too short, he could not see Jesus because of the crowd. He ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree so that he could see Jesus. When Jesus came to the sycamore tree, he said to him, ‘Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for I must stay at your house today’.
Zacchaeus came down from the tree and received Jesus joyfully. The people around murmured because Jesus wanted to be the guest of a sinner. When Jesus got to Zacchaeus’ house, he told Jesus that he would give half of his goods to the poor; that if he had cheated anybody of anything, he would pay back four times the amount of the cheating. Jesus told Zacchaeus, ‘Today, salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham. For the son of man came to seek and to save the lost’.

**c) Mary Magdalene**
Jesus also demonstrated his love towards Mary Magdalene. Jesus drove out seven demons from her.

**Importance of showing love to one another**
Jesus demonstrated his love to mankind by healing the sick, delivering the Oppressed, opening the eyes of the blind, healing many diseases, and raising up the dead. We can show love to people by taking care of them.

It is important to show love to one another because:
1. Showing love to one another brings peace among people.
2. Showing love makes us draw closer to one another and to God.
3. Showing love to one another brings unity.
4. Showing love to one another brings joy and happiness among people.

### **WEEK 4: Jesus promises his spirit**

When Jesus was about to ascend into Heaven, he promised his disciples the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit represents the spirit of Jesus and of God the father. In John 16:4-11, Jesus told his disciples that he would soon go back to his father. They became very sad. Jesus then explained to them that he would not leave them alone. He said he would send them the Holy Spirit who would be their counsellor. The Holy Spirit would teach the world righteousness and condemn evil in the hearts of people. On Pentecost Day, the Holy Spirit was sent on the twelve apostles. Later other believers started receiving the spirit because the promise was for all who would believe in Jesus. The Holy Spirit guided the early disciples in their work of spreading the Gospel. The same Holy Spirit is also guiding us today as Christians.

**Evidence of the guidance of the spirit of Jesus**
**a) The choice of Paul and Barnabas**
In the Church at Antioch in Syria, there were prophets and teachers. Paul and Barnabas were among them. One day, while they were worshipping and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, ‘Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul (Paul) for the work to which I have called them.’ The work the Holy Spirit said he had called them for was missionary work or evangelism as the messengers of God. She started following them screaming, ‘These are the servants of the Most High God who proclaim to you the way of salvation’. Paul had to cast out the evil spirit in her and she got converted. She was no longer practising soothsaying. This is because the evil spirit in her that was helping her in that pagan practice had been cast out.

The owners of the slave girl who were making money out of her soothsaying got angry with Paul. They took them to the magistrates at a market place and lied that they were disturbing people and teaching them bad things. The people there at the market place attacked them. The magistrates did not wait to find out the truth. They immediately gave an order that Paul and Silas should be beaten with rods.

After beating them with rods, they bound them and put them in the inner prison with very tight security. While they were in the prison bound in chains, the Spirit of Christ in them made them not to be afraid. They were praising and worshipping God and other prisoners listened to them. As they were singing at midnight, God sent a very strong earthquake that shook the prison house. The fetters they bound Paul and Silas with broke. The prison doors opened but Paul and Silas did not run away. When the prison guard saw that the prison doors were open, he wanted to kill himself because he thought that Paul and Silas had escaped. He did not want to face the punishment of being killed. As Paul and Silas saw him trying to kill himself, they stopped him and he saw that they did not run away after all. Having seen all that happened, the prison guard changed. He took Paul and Silas to his house that very night. He washed their wounds and served them food. He was converted with all the members of his family.

While Paul and Silas were in the prison guard’s house, the magistrates sent policemen to tell them that they had been released. Paul said that the magistrates must come and apologise to them for not respecting their rights as Roman citizens. They were punished without being given fair trial. The magistrates had to come to the prison guard’s house and apologised to them. After that Paul and Silas left Philippi.

### **WEEK 5 & 6: The gifts of the Holy Spirit**

When Paul was persecuting the Christians in Jerusalem before his conversion, many disciples left the place and went to other parts of the world. The Spirit of Christ was with them guiding them on how to do the work of the Gospel. An example was Philip who went to Samaria and preached the Gospel. The Spirit of Christ in him made him to convert many people and to baptise them in the name of Jesus. The Spirit of Christ also gave him the power to heal the lame and blind people. He also cast demons from those that were possessed.

The Spirit also made Peter to have the power to lay hands on people and they received the Holy Spirit. When some believers that remained in Jerusalem heard that Philip had converted a lot of people to Christianity in Samaria, they were happy. They sent Peter to go and lay hands on them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of Christ through Peter exposed one false convert who was a magician. He was called Simon the great because of his great magical power. He was among those that came out as believers and was baptised by Philip. He showed that he was not a true believer when he tried to offer money to Peter to sell to him the power of making people receive the Holy Spirit.

Peter was angry with him and told him to perish with his money. Peter said to him that the gift of God cannot be bought or sold. He advised Simon to pray to God for forgiveness of his evil intention. Simon repented and begged Peter to pray to God for him for forgiveness. The Spirit of Christ also directed Philip from Samaria to Gaza, to join one Ethiopian man in his chariot. The man went to Jerusalem to worship and was reading a passage from Isaiah as he was coming back. The passage was about Christ but the Ethiopian did not understand. When Philip joined the man in his chariot, he asked whether the man understood what he was reading. The man said no and asked for assistance.

Philip interpreted the passage to him and the man understood things about Christ and believed in him. So, when they came to where there was water, the Ethiopian told Philip to baptise him and Philip did. The man went home a believer in Christ and was happy. The Spirit took Philip to another place. Concerning Philip and Peter, we notice the following gifts of the Holy Spirit:
1. Wisdom to preach the Gospel and convert people.
2. Power to perform miracles of healing.
3. Power to lay hands on people for the gift of the Holy Spirit.
4. Wisdom to interpret the word of God.

Jesus told his disciples that the Holy Spirit would be their counsellor and their teacher. He would help them remember all things. He said that the Spirit would guide them in the way of truth so that they would not speak by their own authority. They would speak only what they heard. The Spirit would reveal to them things to come.

**The role of the Holy Spirit in the life of the present day Christians**
In our lives as Christians, the Holy Spirit enables us to:
1. hate life of sin.
2. fellowship with one another.
3. show true love to others.
4. preach the word of God with truth.
5. condemn boldly the corrupt practices in our country.
6. perform genuine miracles such as that of healing.
7. prophesy.
8. get revelations from God.
9. have the wisdom to understand and interpret the word of God.
10. speak in tongues genuinely.
11. interpret speaking in tongues.
12. have discerning spirit (to know a person operating with good spirit and the one operating with bad spirit, especially in prophecy).

**THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT**
According to Paul in his teaching, a person that has the Holy Spirit in him manifests these qualities in his daily life activities – love, joy, peace, patience or longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, self-control, and so on. With the above qualities, we would be able to be law-abiding towards God and men.

### **WEEK 6 & 7: Jesus gives us a new life**

**What new life means**
A new life means a changed life. It means that a person living in sin suddenly changes and gives up his sinful ways. As a result:
1. The old character gives way to a new character.
2. The old way that led to destruction now changes and leads to a new life of salvation.
3. The old attitude changes to new attitude.
4. The old attitude of cheating, lying, fighting, abusing, cheating in examination, disobedience, etc, now changes to telling the truth, loving, obedience and kindness.
A new life in Christ means that a sinner who had lived his life in deceit, lying, disobedience, and so on, now accepts Jesus Christ into his life and so becomes a child of God. Such a person has a new life. New life can only come through Jesus Christ. Repentance of sins and acceptance of Jesus Christ will give us a new life.

**Evidence of a new life**
When a person’s life changes, it is evident in his character, attitude and behaviour. The life of a person with new life will have joy, kindness, peace, and other virtues. The behaviour of the changed life will be noticed by the people around. The story of the Philippian jailer is an example of the evidence of a new life.
Paul and Silas went to Philippi to preach the gospel of Christ. They met a slave girl who had an evil spirit. Paul cast out the spirit. The owner of the girl realised that the means of making money through evil spirit had been stopped. Paul and Silas were arrested and accused of disturbing the city. The magistrates ordered them to be flogged. After beating them they threw them into prison. The jailer was instructed to keep them in prison.
At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God. Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, the foundation of the prison shook, all the doors were opened and every chain was loosened. The jailer woke up and wanted to kill himself, he thought that the prisoners had escaped. Paul told him that they were still in prison. The jailer became afraid. He asked Paul and Silas, ‘What must I do to be saved’? They said, ‘Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household’.
Paul and Silas spoke the word of God to him. He accepted Christ the same hour. He took Paul and Silas to his house and prepared food for them. He rejoiced with his household that he had believed in God.

**The fruits of a new life**
The Holy Spirit gives the fruits of the spirit to a person with new life. The fruits of the spirit are:
1. Love
2. Joy
3. Peace
4. Patience
5. Kindness
6. Goodness
7. Faithfulness
8. Gentleness
9. Self-control
These fruits will be shown in the character of the person who changes from his old ways to a new way. The evidence of these fruits will be seen and known by both the changed person and the people around him.

**Characteristics of a new life**
The characteristics of a new life in Christ are:
1. Obedience
2. Right-living
3. Kindness
4. Being honest
5. Speaking the truth
6. Self-control
7. Gentleness
8. Showing love
9. Forgiving one another

### **WEEK 8 & 9: Jesus prayed to the father**

**Reasons why Jesus prayed**
Prayer is a means of talking to our heavenly father. Jesus, while he was physically here on earth, did pray to his father. Why did Jesus pray? He prayed to receive power, strength and grace to fulfill his mission, or task, on earth. Jesus always prayed to be a role model to his disciples. He also prayed to honour God, his father. We as the followers of Jesus must do the same.

**Contents of Jesus’ prayer**
Jesus taught us how to pray when he gave us ‘The Lord’s Prayer’. So, when we pray we should first give thanks to God. We thank God for giving us a new a day, a new life. We thank him for providing food, clothes, money for our parents. After thanks, we should confess our sins. We must forgive those who have offended us. This is to allow God to forgive us our own sins.
We should tell God what we need. For instance,
1. We can tell God to give us wisdom, understanding so as to pass our examinations.
2. We can also pray to the Lord to let the government show concern for the citizens of this country.
3. Our prayer could be to ask the Lord to grant mummy and daddy sound health.
4. We must thank the Lord for hearing our prayers.
5. All prayers must be in the name of Jesus.

**Instances when Jesus prayed**
Jesus was always praying. Before he chose the twelve apostles, he went to pray. He prayed all night. When Mary and Martha sent for Jesus on the death of their brother, Lazarus, Jesus went to the grave, thanked God and prayed for the dead Lazarus to rise up. The prayer was answered. Lazarus came back to life. At the end of Jesus’ life here on earth, when he faced death, he prayed seriously at the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus was always prayerful. We should always follow his examples of prayer.

**Importance of prayer**
It is important to talk to our heavenly father. When we do this, we shall have a right relationship with God. When we pray and ask God for our needs such as sound health, protection, wisdom and so on, God will answer us and we will become happy. Prayer is also important because it builds our confidence in God. When we are confident in God, we trust him more.

### **WEEK 10 & 11: God is with us / Zacchaeus**

It is good to know that God is omnipresent (everywhere at one time)—it is one of His attributes. Coinciding with His omnipresence are the attributes of omniscience (all knowledge) and omnipotence (all power). These concepts are a bit much for us humans to comprehend, but God knows that, too (Isaiah 55:8). God fills His creation and is universally present in person, in understanding, and in power at all times. “He is not far from any one of us” (Acts 17:27).

On a more personal level, God is with all believers today in that His Holy Spirit indwells us. This indwelling can only happen if one is born again (John 3:3). First John 5:11-12 tells us it is Jesus who indwells us: “This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.” And Jesus said the Father comes to abide with us: “Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them” (John 14:23).

One of Jesus’ titles is “Immanuel,” which means “God with us” (Matthew 1:23). When Jesus came into this world, He was truly, literally “God with us.” Because God is with us, we know that we will never be separated from His love (Romans 8:38-39). God’s presence assures us that we can accomplish His will for us (1 Chronicles 22:17-19). God’s presence overcomes our fear, worry, and dissatisfaction (Hebrews 13:5).

The Holy Spirit in us is always praying for us (Romans 8:26). We are told to pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17), which means we should maintain an attitude of prayer and receptiveness in order to verbalize prayer to God whenever He leads. He is near to His children, attentive to their cry (Psalm 34:15).

**Zacchaeus Is Curious About Jesus**
Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. A man named Zacchaeus lived there. He was a chief tax collector and was very rich. Zacchaeus wanted to see who Jesus was. But he was a short man. He could not see Jesus because of the crowd. So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree. He wanted to see Jesus, who was coming that way. - Luke 19:1-4

Zacchaeus was a man who worked for the Roman government collecting taxes. Many of the tax collectors were also very dishonest, and collected more money than they were supposed to, which they kept for themselves. So for these reasons tax collectors were not very popular people in their communities. And because Zacchaeus was the chief tax collector—the boss of all the other tax collectors—he was probably especially disliked.

When Jesus traveled through Zacchaeus’ town of Jericho, He was on His way to Jerusalem. So many people followed Jesus wherever He went. Everyone wanted to hear Him teach and see Him heal the sick. And Zacchaeus was no exception. There was only one problem. Zacchaeus was much smaller than everyone else in the crowd. Finally, Zacchaeus had an idea. He ran ahead of the crowd and climbed up into the biggest tree he could find. It was a sycamore fig tree. Finally, little Zacchaeus the tax collector, could see what Jesus was up to.

**Zacchaeus Is Called By Name**
Jesus reached the spot where Zacchaeus was. He looked up and said, “Zacchaeus, come down at once. I must stay at your house today.” So Zacchaeus came down at once and welcomed Him gladly. All the people saw this. They began to whisper among themselves. They said, “Jesus has gone to be the guest of a ‘sinner.’ ”

Jesus stopped right under the tree where the little tax collector was perched and did something really surprising. He called Zacchaeus by name! The two men had never met before, yet Jesus knew everything about Zacchaeus. Because Jesus is God, He knew all there was to know about the man in the tree—his name, his job, even the number of hairs on his head! When Zacchaeus heard Jesus tell him to come down from the tree, he came down immediately.

**Zacchaeus Becomes A New Creation**
But Zacchaeus stood up. He said, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of what I own to those who are poor. And if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay it back. I will pay back four times the amount I took.” Jesus said to Zacchaeus, “Today salvation has come to your house... The Son of Man came to look for the lost and save them.”

Zacchaeus was completely changed by his encounter with Jesus. Zacchaeus repented of his sins right there, in front of Jesus and the crowd. True repentance means that you “change your mind” and “turn away from sin.” Zacchaeus demonstrated his repentance by saying he would give half his money to the poor and that he would make things right with anyone he had cheated. He truly became a new man that day. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, *Anyone who believes in Christ is a new creation. The old is gone! The new has come!* That is what happened to Zacchaeus when he decided to repent and follow Jesus.
