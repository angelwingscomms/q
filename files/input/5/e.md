Every morning, Lily would step into her vibrant garden. Her favorite bloom was a radiant red rose, its petals soft and velvety. Soon, tiny, industrious bees would arrive, buzzing around the rose, diligently gathering sweet nectar. In the cool evenings, Lily often sat on her small porch, observing the colorful sunset paint the sky. The peaceful quiet of her garden always brought her a sense of calm and happiness. Her garden, though not sprawling, was a treasure trove of beauty and tranquility.

present this exact poem ask 5 simple questions on it:
```plaintext
In meadows green, where daisies gleam,
A gentle stream began to flow.
A tiny fish, a silver dream,
Swam gracefully, swift and low.
The sun shone down, a golden light,
Upon the water, clear and cool.
A buzzing bee took happy flight,
From flower to flower, a busy tool.
The quiet breeze, a soft sigh,
Made willow branches gently sway.
```
