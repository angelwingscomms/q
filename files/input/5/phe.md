Parts of the Body and functions

The respiratory System

Respiratory Respiration is the the process of taking in oxygen, sending out carbon dioxide and the use of oxygen that has been taken in.
Breathing is the process of taking in oxygen and bringing out carbon dioxide. When we take in oxygen it is called Inspiration because it involves breathing in.
When We breathe out Carbon dioxide it is called Expiration.
Funtions of the respiratory System
i. it toakes oxygen to the lungs, then to other parts of the body.
ii. Through the process of respiratoin our body the body gets rid of waste carbon dioxide and water vapour vapour.

---
**Page 11**

iii. It helps to regulate our body temperature respiration.
Breathing involves respiratory organs like the nose, Larynx, trachea, diaphragm and the lungs.
1- Nose: We breathe in air through the nose, The nose filters dust and germs with the help of tiny hairs in the nostrils. It also warm and wets the air.
2. Larynx (Voice Box)
Air that has been filtered passes through the same route as pod on it's way to the Larynx. Another name for the larynx is the voi box The larynx is on top of the trachea.
3. Trachea (Wind pipe)
The trachea is also called wind pipe. Air moves from the larynx to the trachea The trachea is flexible. This is why we can bend our from one side to the other. Behind the middle of our breast bone the trachea divides into: righ and left bronchi.

Diagram of the lungs
[A diagram of the lungs is shown with the following labels:]
- Right bronchus
- Larynx
- Trachea
- upper lobe (on the right lung drawing)
- middle lobe
- lower lobe
- upper lobe (on the left lung drawing)
- lower lobe

4. Lungs. The lungs are the most important organ of breathing. Air moves from the bachea into the lungs making the blood rich contain millions of air sacs like balbons called alveoli. The air sacs are then filled with air. The air mixes with the blood making the blood rich in oxygen and thereby making the blood transport oxygen to other part of the body.

Care of The respiratory system
1. We need regular exercise to make our lungs work well

---
**Page 13**

2. We need to take deep breaths for a few manites everyday to ventilate our lungs.
3. We must avoid mouth breathing.
4. We must avoid smoking so that our nose will not be damaged.

Circulatory system
Circulatory system is the process by which blood moves around the body.
Blood is very important to the body. Without the blood the body cannot work. When blood stops flowing or circulating in the body death is the resul.

The circulatory System

**Page 14**

[A simplified drawing of the circulatory system is shown.]

The circulatory system involves the heart, blood and blood vessels.
The heart. The heart beats is like a pumping machine The beats 72 times per minute The heart is divided into the left and right sides. The left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to all parts of the body. The blood that has been pumped out comes back with carbon dioxide to the

right half - It is then pumped back into the Lungs to receive fresh oxygen. This circle continues again and again.

The human heart
[A diagram of the heart is shown with the following labels:]
- Horta (Aorta)
- Right atrium
- left atrium
- Left ventricle
- Right ventricle

The blood The liquids that is pumped by the heart is called the blood. Blood is made up of water and other materials. the blood transports food to parts of the body. It also transports oxygen from the lungs to the body. It also transports waste materials to the excretory organs like the kidney.

---
**Page 16**

Blood also contains anti-bodies that prot-uce protect the body against infections.
Blood generally transport food and other materials round the body.

Blood vessels: These are tubes which blood to other parts of the body - The heart pumps blood into the blood vessels. There are two types of blood vessels. They are the arteries and the veins.
The heart pumps blood into the arteries and the veins bring back blood that has been mixed with carbon dioxide into the heart for purification.

The Excretory System.
Excretion is the removal of waste products from the body. As our carries out it's daily work, wastes are formed in the body, which has to be removed these wastes are called as a result of chemical reactions that takes place in the body. these waste Include

ii. Exess salt
iii. Water and heat
iv Nitrogenous waste.

**Page 18**

All these come from the living cells of the body- faeces passed out of the alimentary canal are not said to be excreted because they are Substances which have not entered the living cells of the body.

Examples of the excretory organs are: lungs, Skin and the kidney. The organs are called the exe. excretory organs.
1. Lungs: - The lungs remove carbon dioxide. A little quantity of water in the form of water vapour or heat may also come out if the air is dry or cold
2. Skin: - the skin removes excess heat from the body in form of Sweat
3. kidney: - The kidney removes waste from the body. It also expels excess salt and water in the form of urine from the body. The kidney has two parts, they are - the corter and the medulla, pelvis, Cwhere the ubeter joins the kidney, there.
