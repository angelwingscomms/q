Section B (Short Answer) Answers:
1. Lever, Pulley, Wheel and Axle, Inclined Plane, Wedge, Screw (any three)
2. A wedge uses force applied to its blunt end to separate or hold objects apart, converting vertical force into horizontal splitting force.
3. A simple machine has few or no moving parts and changes the direction or magnitude of a force, while a complex machine combines two or more simple machines.
4. Example: A doorknob (wheel and axle) allows us to easily open and close doors by rotating a small force over a larger distance to turn the latch mechanism.

Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Key points: Early tools (lever, wedge) for hunting, building, agriculture. Enabled construction of pyramids, ancient technologies. Foundation for industrial revolution. Allowed humans to amplify force, change direction, and move heavy objects, leading to societal progress.
2. Key points: Complex machines are combinations of simple machines. Examples: Bicycle (wheel and axle, lever, gears which are modified wheels), Scissors (two levers, two wedges), Wheelbarrow (wheel and axle, lever). Explain how each simple machine contributes to the overall function.
3. Key points: Still fundamental in modern society despite advanced technology. Examples: Cranes (pulleys, levers), car jacks (screws, levers), door hinges (levers), ramps (inclined planes), zippers (wedges, inclined planes). They provide mechanical advantage, reduce effort, and are cost-effective, durable solutions in various industries and household tasks.
