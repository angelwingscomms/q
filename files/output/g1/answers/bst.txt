Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Underdeveloped technology is less advanced and often requires more manual effort (e.g., grinding stone), while developed technology is more modern and efficient (e.g., blender).
2. Plants are living things because they are sensitive to touch or sunlight, need air to survive, and have the ability to reproduce. They also feed, move parts, and excrete.
3. Light energy is crucial for green plants because they use it to make their own food through the process of photosynthesis.
4. Natural sources of light are objects that produce light on their own, such as the Sun and stars. Artificial sources are human-made objects that give off light, like gas light or electric bulbs.
5. Light travels in a straight line. Sunlight is an example of light energy that demonstrates this characteristic.
