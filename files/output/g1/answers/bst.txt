Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Underdeveloped technology refers to older, less efficient tools and methods, often relying on manual labor or natural resources directly (e.g., grinding stone, firewood, mud house, well water, horse-drawn carriage, gong). Developed technology refers to modern, more efficient, and often industrialized tools and methods that improve convenience and productivity (e.g., blender, electric cooker, storey building, pipe-borne water, aircraft, radio).
2. Light energy is crucial for green plants as they use it for photosynthesis to make their own food, which forms the base of most food chains. In everyday life, light illuminates places, allowing us to see in the dark (e.g., from bulbs, stars) and is essential for human activities and well-being. Sunlight also makes our days bright.
3. Plants are classified as living organisms because they exhibit several key characteristics: 1) Sensitivity: They respond to stimuli like touch or sunlight. 2) Respiration/Need for Air: They require air to survive. 3) Reproduction: They have the ability to create new plants. 4) Nutrition: They feed on food substances like nutrients and water from the soil. 5) Movement: They can move parts, like turning towards the sun. 6) Excretion: They can remove unwanted substances.
4. The two main sources of light energy are Natural Sources and Artificial Sources. Natural sources originate from nature, such as the Sun and other stars. Artificial sources are man-made, including gas lights and electric bulbs.
5. The concept that light travels in a straight line explains phenomena like shadows, where an opaque object blocks light, creating a clear outline behind it. It also explains why we can see objects directly in our line of sight, and how light from a projector forms a clear image on a screen without bending around obstacles.
