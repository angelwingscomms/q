Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Underdeveloped technologies are traditional, less efficient, and often manual, e.g., grinding stone for food processing, firewood for cooking, mud house for accommodation, well water, horse-drawn carriage, and gong. Developed technologies are modern, efficient, and often automated or advanced, e.g., blender, electric cooker, storey building, pipe-borne water, aircraft, and radio.
2. Plants are living organisms because they are sensitive to touch or sunlight, they need air to survive, and they have the ability to reproduce. Additionally, they feed on soil nutrients and water, can move their parts, and excrete unwanted substances.
3. Light energy is a form of energy that illuminates places. It travels in a straight line. Examples of light sources include sunlight, light bulbs, and stars.
4. The two main sources of light are natural and artificial. Natural sources are those that occur in nature, such as the Sun and other stars. Artificial sources are man-made, such as gas light and electric bulbs.
5. Without developed technology, food processing would be laborious (e.g., manual grinding), cooking would rely on less efficient methods like firewood, and accommodation would be basic (mud houses). This would lead to more time and effort spent on basic survival, less convenience, and potentially lower living standards compared to modern times.
