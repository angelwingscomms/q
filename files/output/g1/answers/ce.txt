Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Highway codes establish a standardized set of rules, regulations, and symbols that guide all road users. Their primary purpose is to prevent accidents, minimize fatalities and injuries, and ensure the orderly and responsible movement of traffic. They achieve this by setting guidelines for behavior, vehicle operation, and the interpretation of road signs, ultimately safeguarding lives and property.
2. Looking left, right, and left again is a critical safety measure because it ensures that a pedestrian checks for approaching vehicles from all directions, including those that might have been missed on the first check or vehicles that have just turned onto the road. This triple check significantly reduces the risk of stepping into the path of an oncoming vehicle, especially in areas with varied traffic patterns.
3. Traffic lights are essential for regulating the flow of traffic at intersections and pedestrian crossings. They use a universal color code (red for stop, yellow for prepare to stop, green for go) to assign right-of-way, preventing collisions and allowing for organized movement. By controlling when vehicles and pedestrians can proceed, they minimize congestion and enhance safety for all road users.
4. Beyond safeguarding lives, highway codes promote responsible and orderly use of roads by providing clear guidelines for behavior, reducing erratic driving. They also ensure that reckless drivers are identified, arrested, and punished, thereby deterring dangerous behavior and maintaining law and order on the roads. These aspects contribute to a more predictable and safer driving environment for everyone.
5. Security refers to the state of safety, well-being, freedom, and peace, essentially protection from dangers to life and property. Its significance for national development is paramount because a secure environment allows citizens to freely engage in economic, social, and political activities without fear. Without security, instability and danger hinder investment, disrupt daily life, and prevent the effective implementation of development initiatives, thus stalling progress.
