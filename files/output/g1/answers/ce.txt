Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Wearing bright or reflective clothing makes pedestrians more visible to drivers, especially in low light conditions, reducing the risk of accidents.
2. Traffic lights regulate the flow of vehicles and pedestrians at intersections. Red means stop, preventing collisions; green means go, allowing movement; yellow warns to prepare to stop, ensuring smooth transitions and preventing sudden braking or acceleration, thus enhancing overall road safety.
3. Highway codes provide a standardized set of rules for all road users. By outlining proper conduct (e.g., speed limits, right-of-way, lane discipline), they create predictability and order, reducing chaos and promoting a responsible driving culture. They also include penalties for violations, reinforcing adherence.
4. The Pedestrian Crossing (Zebra Crossing) sign is crucial as it designates safe areas for pedestrians to cross. For drivers, it mandates stopping and yielding to pedestrians, prioritizing pedestrian safety. For pedestrians, it indicates a recognized and safer point to cross, reducing risks associated with crossing elsewhere.
5. Security is fundamental for national development and progress. Without it, economic activities (trade, investment), social interactions (community building, education), and political processes (governance, elections) are disrupted or impossible. Security creates a stable environment, fostering confidence, attracting investment, and allowing citizens to freely pursue activities that contribute to national growth.
