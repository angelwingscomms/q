Section C (Theory) Answers:

2. Proper nouns are specific names of people or organizations (e.g., John, London), while common nouns are general names for people, places, or things (e.g., teacher, city). The key difference is specificity.
3. Collective nouns refer to groups of people, animals, or things (e.g., family, flock, team). They differ from other nouns by representing a collection as a single unit.
4. Pronouns replace nouns in a sentence to avoid repetition and make sentences more concise. Personal pronouns (e.g., I, you, he) replace specific subjects or objects. Possessive pronouns (e.g., mine, ours, hers) show ownership.
5. Verbs are words that show action or what someone or something is doing. They indicate the activity or state of the subject. Examples of action verbs include run, think, read, learn, remember.
6. In 'We travelled to School in the car.', the nouns are: School, car. In 'I love going to Wexford on holiday.', the nouns are: Wexford, holiday.
