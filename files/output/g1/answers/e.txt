2. I, you

Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Proper Nouns are specific names (e.g., John, London), while Common Nouns are general names (e.g., teacher, city).
2. Abstract Nouns are concepts or feelings that cannot be touched or seen, only felt. Examples: Love, peace.
3. Pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition. Personal pronouns replace specific nouns (I, he, she), and possessive pronouns show ownership (mine, yours).
4. Action verbs show physical or mental action (run, think), while linking verbs connect the subject to additional information (is, seems).
5. Collective nouns refer to a group of people, animals, or things as a single unit. For example, a "swarm" of bees or a "choir" of singers.
