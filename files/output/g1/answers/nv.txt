Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Drugs are substances, excluding food and water, that alter the body's physical and mental functions. While primarily used to cure illness, they can also be abused for other purposes.
2. Traditional herbal drugs are naturally occurring substances derived from natural sources like plants (leaves, roots, barks), animals, chalk, and charcoal, often used in their natural form.
3. Traditional drugs are usually served in their natural form, often as leaves, roots, or barks of trees, and are typically administered without strict dosage compliance. Modern drugs, conversely, are processed, refined, and come in specific doses.
4. Modern drugs are artificially processed and come in specific doses. Traditional drugs occur naturally, are administered in their natural state, and often lack strict dosage compliance.
5. Modern drugs extract active ingredients, contain synthetic substances (chemicals, preservatives), and have expiry dates. Traditional drugs use the entire plant, are preserved naturally, and usually lack specific expiry dates.
6. This is not a question, so no answer is required.
