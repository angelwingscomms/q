Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Peaceful co-existence is vital for societal harmony, preventing disagreements and fights. The text shows Jesus teaching forgiveness and peaceful living. Biblical examples like Esau and Jacob, Philemon and Onesimus, Isaac and Abimelech, and Abraham and Lot illustrate reconciliation and conflict prevention, leading to peaceful community life.
2. Jesus' teachings, particularly on forgiveness, are central to peaceful co-existence. By advising forgiveness for offenders, Jesus promotes reconciliation and prevents grudges or conflicts from escalating. This approach ensures people can live happily together, fostering an environment of peace rather than discord.
3. Jonathan and David's relationship is a powerful example of unselfish love, where Jonathan loved David as himself. Jonathan demonstrated this by warning David of King Saul's murderous intentions and hiding him, risking his own safety and royal standing. Key takeaways include loyalty, self-sacrifice, and the profound impact of true, unconditional friendship.
4. The moral responsibility of showing unselfish love involves considering others, showing hospitality, being truthful and open-minded. Practically, this means sharing belongings, protecting those in danger, and helping the needy. These actions demonstrate care and contribute to a supportive community, aligning with Jesus' desire for people to show love.
5. Consistent practice of showing love and unselfishness builds a harmonious and peaceful society by fostering empathy, trust, and mutual support. When individuals prioritize others' well-being, it minimizes conflict, encourages cooperation, and strengthens community bonds. This collective behavior creates an environment where people live together in peace, reducing societal friction and promoting overall well-being.
