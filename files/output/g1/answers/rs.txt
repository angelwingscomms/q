Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Peaceful Co-existence means different people living together in peace without disagreement or fight. It is important because it fosters harmony, prevents conflict, and aligns with Jesus' teachings to forgive and live happily together, as well as God's desire for people to live peacefully in the community.
2. Jesus taught that if someone offends us, we should forgive them. This teaching is crucial for maintaining peaceful coexistence, as holding grudges or seeking retaliation would lead to conflict. Forgiveness allows people to move past disagreements and continue living happily together.
3. Jonathan and David showed unselfish love, with Jonathan loving David as his own soul. When King Saul, Jonathan's father, planned to kill David, Jonathan risked his own safety and loyalty by informing David of the danger and helping him hide. Their love was so strong that they even made a covenant.
4. Showing love and unselfishness is a moral responsibility because it aligns with Jesus' teachings to show love and hospitality. It involves considering others, telling them the truth, and being open-minded. This fosters a positive environment, helps those in need, and strengthens community bonds.
5. The text states two ways: sharing our belongings with others and protecting one another when there is danger. These actions are significant because they demonstrate practical care and empathy, build stronger relationships, ensure mutual support, and contribute to a safer and more loving society, fulfilling the call to help the needy and show love.
