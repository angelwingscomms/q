Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Peaceful co-existence means living without disagreement or conflict. Jesus taught forgiveness to foster peace. Biblical examples like Esau and Jacob, Philemon and Onesimus, Isaac and Abimelech, and Abraham and Lot illustrate God's desire for people to live happily together, preventing quarrels and promoting community harmony.
2. Unselfish love is defined as showing love and hospitality to others, considering those around us. It entails moral responsibilities such as telling people the truth, being open-minded, and actively showing care and concern for others' well-being.
3. Jonathan loved David as his own soul, demonstrating profound loyalty. When King Saul planned to kill David, Jonathan selflessly warned David, hid him, and they solidified their bond through a covenant. Their actions exemplified deep, unselfish love and unwavering loyalty despite Jonathan's familial ties to Saul.
4. Pupils and society members can demonstrate love by sharing belongings with others, showing love to those in danger, and giving help to the needy. Specifically, protecting one another when there is danger is also mentioned as a key way to show love.
5. Both peaceful co-existence and unselfish love are fundamental Christian values that are crucial for a harmonious community. Peaceful co-existence ensures living together without conflict, fostering unity and happiness. Unselfish love promotes care, truthfulness, hospitality, and mutual protection among individuals. Together, these values create a supportive and loving environment where people thrive and live in accordance with God's will and Jesus' teachings.
