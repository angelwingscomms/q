Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Peaceful co-existence means different people living together in peace without disagreement. The text highlights its importance through biblical examples like Esau and Jacob reconciling, Philemon and Onesimus, Isaac and Abimelech, and Abraham preventing a quarrel with Lot, all demonstrating a desire for harmony.
2. Jesus taught that if someone offends us, we should forgive them and live happily together. This teaching is central to peaceful co-existence because forgiveness removes grudges and allows individuals to move past conflicts, fostering an environment where people can live together without disagreement or fight.
3. Jonathan and David's relationship exemplifies unselfish love through Jonathan's actions. Jonathan loved David 'as his own soul' and risked his own safety by warning David about King Saul's murderous plans and hiding him. Their covenant further solidified this bond, showing deep care and loyalty beyond self-interest.
4. Individuals have a moral responsibility to show love and hospitality, tell the truth, and be open-minded to others. This involves considering those around us, showing love to those in danger, and giving help to the needy. Practical ways include sharing belongings and protecting one another.
5. Pupils can apply these principles by sharing their belongings with classmates, protecting one another from harm or bullying, showing empathy and hospitality to new students, being truthful in their interactions, and being open-minded to diverse perspectives. This fosters a loving and supportive school community.
