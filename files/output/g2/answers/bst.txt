2. Safe handling prevents accidents and injuries. Examples include using a knife carefully, holding it correctly, and carefully passing scissors to others. Carelessness can lead to harm.
3. Different materials are chosen based on the machine's purpose and required properties. For instance, scissors use metal for cutting blades and plastic for handles (grip/insulation), a broom uses raffia for sweeping, and a catapult uses wood for structure and rubber for elasticity.
4. Energy is the ability to do work. It is crucial for almost all human activities, enabling us to perform tasks like washing clothes, working on the farm, carrying loads, cooking, walking, and bathing. Without energy, these actions would be impossible.
5. Common household items that consume energy include stoves (for heating/cooking), heaters (for warmth), torches (for light), fridges (for cooling/preservation), bulbs (for light), televisions (for entertainment/information), and fans (for cooling/air circulation). Each utilizes energy to perform its specific function.
