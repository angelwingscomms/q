1. A radio passes audio sound programmes and messages to the public. It uses an antenna to receive sound messages, a knob to tune to different stations, and a speaker through which the sound is finally passed to the listener.
2. A computer is an electronic device designed to process data and provide information. It consists of a monitor, which displays the input from the keyboard, and a system unit, which is crucial for connecting all other peripheral devices.
3. Both mobile phones and radios are IT devices used for communication. A radio primarily transmits audio sound programmes and messages to the public in a broadcast manner, while a mobile phone is a small radio telephone used for direct, long-distance communication between individuals, involving dialing numbers.
4. A digital wristwatch is worn on the wrist and serves to display time. Its key feature is showing the time in numbers, specifically indicating the hour, minute, and second, providing a quick and clear reference for time.
5. IT devices are fundamental in enabling information exchange from person to person and place to place. For instance, televisions provide visual news and entertainment, radios broadcast audio messages, and mobile phones facilitate long-distance verbal communication. Computers process data into usable information, and calculators aid in numerical tasks, all contributing to efficient information handling.
