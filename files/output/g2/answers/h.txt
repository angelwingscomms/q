Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Beyond literature, he played active roles in Nigeria's political history and its struggle with British Colonization. He was imprisoned for many years, indicating his activism and commitment to political change.
2. Chief Anthony Enahoro was a leading anti-colonial and pro-democracy activist. His most significant contribution was being the first Nigerian to move the motion for Nigeria's independence, which was eventually granted in 1960. This act was pivotal in the country's self-governance.
3. Alhaja Kudirat Abiola played a crucial role in Nigeria's pro-democracy movement after the 1993 election, standing firm with her husband, Chief MKO Abiola, who was imprisoned. She actively fought for Nigeria to be free from military rule and advocated for a democratic 'government of the people, by the people and for the people'. Her assassination in 1996 underscored her unwavering commitment to democracy.
4. Traditional rulers serve as custodians of culture and other domains. Their responsibilities include settling land and marriage quarrels, supporting good leaders, educating people on their civic duties (like voting and paying taxes), punishing bad behavior, and ensuring people obey law and order within the community.
5. Both Chief Anthony Enahoro and Alhaja Kudirat Abiola were significant figures in Nigeria's political history, albeit in different eras. Enahoro was a prominent anti-colonial activist, instrumental in the struggle for independence by moving the motion for self-rule. Kudirat Abiola, on the other hand, was a pro-democracy activist who fought against military rule post-independence, advocating for the restoration of civilian governance after the annulled 1993 election. While Enahoro's struggle was for sovereignty from colonial powers, Kudirat's was for internal democratic governance.
