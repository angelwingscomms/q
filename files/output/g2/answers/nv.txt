2. Overdose means to take an excessive amount of food or drink. It is considered a bad habit because it leads to various negative health signs and effects such as stooling, vomiting, fainting, sleeplessness, and stomach-pain, which are detrimental to one's well-being.
3. The common signs of overdose include: Stooling (frequent bowel movements), Vomiting (expelling stomach contents), Fainting (loss of consciousness), Sleeplessness (inability to sleep), and Stomach-pain (discomfort in the abdominal area).
4. Excessive consumption has several negative effects: Drinking too much leads to frequent urination, causes bed-wetting in children before sleep, and makes adults drunk. Inhaling too much smoke can cause a person to faint.
5. To assist a person suffering from an overdose, they should be taken to the hospital immediately. If the person faints, first aid should be applied to revive them. Additionally, children observed smoking or drinking alcohol should be reported to their teacher and parents for intervention.
