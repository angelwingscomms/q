Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Rest is crucial for both physical and mental health. It allows muscles to relax, promotes growth in children and adolescents, refreshes the mind and body organs, improves concentration, and ensures proper functioning of vital organs like the brain and heart. Adequate rest prevents harm from prolonged work and supports overall well-being.
2. Ideal sleeping conditions include a comfortable, well-ventilated room, clean and comfortable beddings, and avoiding overcrowding on beds or in rooms. These conditions are important because they create an environment conducive to deep, restorative sleep, which is essential for the body and mind to become inactive and recover effectively.
3. The primary purpose of first aid is to provide immediate assistance to an injured or sick person before professional medical help arrives. This includes easing the victim's pain, preventing their condition from worsening, and stabilizing them until a medical doctor can take over. It bridges the gap between incident and definitive medical care.
4. Bleeding occurs when blood flows out of blood vessels and can be internal or external. To manage severe bleeding, initial steps include calming the patient, ensuring they lie flat, loosening clothes around the neck and waist for easy breathing, raising the bleeding part of the body to reduce blood flow, and raising the foot of the bed to promote blood flow to the brain and prevent fainting.
5. Fainting is defined as a temporary loss of consciousness, where the affected person may lose touch with their surroundings. According to the text, a potential cause of fainting is an insufficient supply of air or blood to the brain. No specific symptoms are mentioned beyond losing touch with surroundings.
