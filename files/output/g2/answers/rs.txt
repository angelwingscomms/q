Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Praying without ceasing emphasizes persistence and constant communion with God, showing reliance and dedication. Praying in secret highlights humility and sincerity, ensuring prayer is for God's attention, not human praise.
2. Jesus demonstrated divine power by commanding elements. Examples include calming a great storm at sea by saying 'Peace be still,' which immediately stopped the wind, and walking on the surface of the sea, defying natural laws.
3. Jesus fed five thousand people with only five loaves and two fish. He took the meager resources, prayed, and distributed them through His disciples, resulting in everyone being satisfied and twelve baskets of leftovers. Lessons include Jesus' compassion, His ability to multiply and provide abundantly from little, and the importance of sharing.
4. The text mentions Jesus' power over natural forces (calming the sea, walking on the sea), His power over diseases (healing Peter's Mother-in-law, the paralysed man), and His power over death (raising Jairus's Daughter, the widow's son, and Lazarus).
5. The main message is that a great prophet has risen, and God has visited His people. This relates to Jesus' actions by affirming that His miracles (healing, raising the dead, controlling nature) are evidence of Him being that great prophet and God's divine presence and intervention among humanity.
