Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Jesus taught five key ways to pray: pray without ceasing (continually), pray in secret (for intimacy with God, not public display), pray without getting discouraged (persevere in prayer), pray in faith without doubt (believe God will answer), and pray for something specific (know what you are asking for).
2. Jesus demonstrated divine power over natural forces. One instance was calming a great storm at sea by simply commanding "Peace be still," causing the wind to stop immediately. Another demonstration was His ability to walk on the sea.
3. After a crowd of five thousand followed Jesus to a mountain, He inquired how to feed them. A boy offered five loaves of bread and two small fishes. Jesus prayed, blessed the food, and distributed it through His disciples. All ate and were satisfied, resulting in 12 full baskets of leftovers.
4. The text mentions three individuals Jesus raised from the dead: Jairus's Daughter, The widow's son, and Lazarus. These acts underscore Jesus' power over death, confirming His divine authority and role as the Son of God.
5. The Memory Verse, "A great prophet is risen up among us; and that God has visited his people," reflects the people's understanding and awe of Jesus after witnessing His miracles. It signifies their recognition of Him as a powerful prophet, whose actions demonstrate God's direct presence and intervention among humanity.
