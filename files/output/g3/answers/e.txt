Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Determiners specify the quantity or identity of a noun. "Few" implies a small, countable number (e.g., few students). "Some" implies an unspecified quantity, used with countable and uncountable nouns (e.g., some books, some water).
2. Adjectives enrich sentences by providing descriptive details about nouns. Examples: The red car, a tall building, happy children, delicious food, brave soldiers.
3. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Adverb of manner (how): She sings beautifully. Adverb of time (when): They arrived yesterday. Adverb of place (where): We live here.
4. A preposition shows the relationship of a noun or pronoun to another word, often indicating location or time. It is usually followed by a noun or pronoun (object of the preposition). Examples: in the box, at noon, under the bridge.
5. The verb "be" changes form based on the subject's number. 'Is' and 'isn't' are used for singular nouns (e.g., The cat is sleeping; The book isn't here). 'Are' and 'aren't' are used for plural nouns (e.g., The students are learning; The chairs aren't comfortable).
