Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Common nouns refer to general categories (e.g., city, dog), while proper nouns refer to specific names (e.g., London, John). Proper nouns are always capitalized.
2. Verbs are crucial because they convey action or state of being, forming the core of the predicate and allowing sentences to express complete thoughts. Without verbs, sentences cannot express what subjects are doing or what state they are in.
3. Pronouns prevent repetitive use of nouns, making sentences more concise and readable. They maintain clarity by referring back to previously mentioned nouns without constantly repeating them, improving the overall flow and coherence of text.
