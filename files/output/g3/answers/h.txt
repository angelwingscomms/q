Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Soyinka's Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986 marked a global recognition of African literary excellence, inspiring other African writers and bringing international attention to African narratives and perspectives. It validated the richness and depth of African storytelling and intellectual thought.
2. Soyinka was a vocal critic of the Nigerian government, leading to his imprisonment multiple times. He was also active in Nigeria's struggle against British Colonization. His activism highlighted issues of human rights, democracy, and good governance, influencing political discourse and contributing to the nation's political evolution.
3. States in Nigeria are created for easy administration and to bring government closer to the people. This aims to decentralize power, ensure equitable distribution of resources, and allow local populations to participate more effectively in governance, thereby enjoying government benefits directly.
4. The table shows varying periods of state creation. Significant periods include 1967 (Cross River, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kwara, Lagos), 1976 (Bauchi, Benue, Borno, Imo, Niger, Ogun), 1987 (Akwa Ibom), 1991 (Abia, Adamawa, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Enugu, Jigawa, Kebbi, Kogi), and 1996 (Bayelsa, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Gombe, Nasarawa). This indicates a continuous process of restructuring for administrative convenience and political considerations.
5. Heroes and heroines like Professor Wole Soyinka embody national values and aspirations. They serve as role models, inspiring citizens through their achievements and struggles. Their contributions in literature, activism, or other fields help define a nation's identity, promote critical thinking, and push for societal progress and justice, leaving a lasting legacy.
