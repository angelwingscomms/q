He also played active roles in Nigeria's political history and its struggle against British Colonization, showcasing his commitment to national liberation and governance.
2. States in Nigeria are primarily created for easy administration and to bring government closer to the people. This decentralization aims to ensure that citizens can more readily enjoy the benefits of governance, fostering better service delivery and local participation.
3. Wole Soyinka's political activism and subsequent imprisonment underscore his role as a critical voice against oppressive governance. His actions highlight the importance of intellectual and artistic figures challenging authority for societal betterment, contributing to the nation's political evolution and struggle for freedom from both colonial and internal injustices.

The provided table indicates several distinct periods of state creation: 1967 (Cross River, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kwara, Lagos), 1976 (Bauchi, Benue, Borno, Imo, Niger, Ogun), 1987 (Akwa Ibom), 1991 (Abia, Adamawa, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Enugu, Jigawa, Kebbi, Kogi), and 1996 (Bayelsa, Ebonyi, Ekiti, Gombe, Nasarawa). This shows waves of state creation, often linked to political restructuring or demands for administrative decentralization.
