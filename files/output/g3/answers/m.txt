Section B (Short Answer) Answers:
1. It tells the number of minutes past or to the hour.
2. It tells the hour.
3. Analogue time uses hands on a clock face (e.g., 5 o'clock), while digital time uses numerical digits (e.g., 5:00).
4. It means 30 minutes past 5 o'clock.
5. A standard clock face typically displays 12 hours.

Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. An analogue clock features a clock face, an hour hand (short, indicates hours), and a minute hand (long, indicates minutes). The hour hand points to the current hour, while the minute hand indicates the minutes past or to the hour.
2. Analogue time is represented visually by hands on a circular clock face, showing the progression of time. Digital time displays time numerically (e.g., HH:MM), providing precise, unambiguous readings. Analogue provides a contextual sense of time, while digital offers precise readings but lacks a visual sense of time passing.
3. "O'clock" signifies an exact hour when the minute hand points to 12 (e.g., 4 o'clock). "Half past" denotes 30 minutes past the hour, occurring when the minute hand points to 6 (e.g., half past 5 or 5:30).
4. To interpret 4 o'clock, the hour hand (short) would point to the 4, and the minute hand (long) would point to the 12. Similarly, for 8 o'clock, the hour hand would point to the 8, and the minute hand would point to the 12.
5. The 12-hour clock system, as seen on a clock face, divides a full day into two 12-hour cycles (AM and PM). This system provides a practical and widely understood method for daily timekeeping, allowing for clear communication of specific times within a day.
