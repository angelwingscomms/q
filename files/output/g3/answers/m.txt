Section B (Short Answer) Answers:
1. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.
2. 3/4
3. Find a common denominator, convert fractions, then add or subtract numerators.
4. 1.7 meters
5. A common multiple of the denominators of two or more fractions.

Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Fractions: Cooking recipes (e.g., 1/2 cup flour), measuring fabric (e.g., 3/4 yard). Decimals: Money (e.g., $5.25), athletic timing (e.g., 9.8 seconds for a race).
2. Multiplication: Multiply numerators and denominators directly. Division: Invert the divisor (second fraction) and then multiply. Key difference: Division requires an extra step of inversion before multiplication.
3. Place value assigns a value to each digit based on its position relative to the decimal point. It's crucial for correctly aligning numbers in addition/subtraction and understanding magnitude in multiplication/division, ensuring accurate calculations.
