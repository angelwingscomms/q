Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Food is essential for growth, maintaining health, and providing energy. It helps the body function properly, repair damaged cells, and protect against diseases.
2. The four types are: Energy-giving food (e.g., yam, maize) for energy; Body-building food (e.g., beans, eggs) for protein; Fatty food (e.g., butter, palm oil) for fat, oil, and cell repair; Protective food (e.g., fruits, vegetables) to protect against diseases.
3. A balanced diet contains all classes of food (carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals) in the right amounts. It is essential because it makes bones and teeth strong, provides energy and strength, and supports overall body health.
4. Regular bathing is important to be clean, neat, and smell nice. It helps to prevent body odor and promotes overall personal hygiene.
5. Menu: Rice and Beans served with boiled egg, fish, stew, and fruit juice. Justification: Rice and Beans provide carbohydrates (energy) and protein (body-building). Boiled egg and fish are excellent sources of protein. Stew (often with vegetables) and fruit juice provide vitamins and minerals (protective food). This combination covers all classes of food in appropriate proportions.
