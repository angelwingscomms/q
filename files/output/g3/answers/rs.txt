Section C (Theory) Answers:
1. Jesus performed many miracles, healing the sick and raising the dead, demonstrating his power over diseases and death.
2. Praying in faith without doubt means having a strong belief that God will hear and respond to our prayers. It emphasizes trust in God's power and willingness to act, which is crucial for effective prayer.
3. Jesus demonstrated his power over natural forces by calming a violent storm on the sea, telling the wind "Peace be still," and by walking on the surface of the sea. These acts show his authority over creation.
4. Jesus fed five thousand people with only five loaves of bread and two small fishes. He prayed over the food, and it multiplied, satisfying everyone with 12 baskets of leftovers. This miracle demonstrates his divine power and compassion.
5. From Jesus' teachings, we learn to pray consistently ("without ceasing"), humbly and privately ("in secret"), persistently ("without getting discouraged"), with unwavering belief ("in faith without doubt"), and with clear intentions ("for something specific").
6. The miracles of healing the sick (like Peter's mother-in-law and the paralysed man) and raising the dead (like Jairus's daughter, the widow's son, and Lazarus) unequivocally show Jesus' divine power over life and death, proving his authority as the Son of God.
