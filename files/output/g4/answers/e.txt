1. Model Answer/Key Points: Sender's address and date. Informal salutation (e.g., Dear [Cousin's Name]). Express excitement for summer holiday. Clearly state the request to learn basketball. Mention why you want to learn (e.g., seen them play, looks fun). Suggest specific times or arrangements. Informal closing (e.g., Yours lovingly, Best regards). Your name.
2. Model Answer/Key Points: Choose a well-known fairy tale (e.g., Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood). Retell the story's plot with new, original names for all main characters. Maintain the core events and moral of the original tale. Ensure clarity and coherence in the narrative.
3. Model Answer/Key Points: Choose a suitable pot/location. Fill with good quality soil. Place the seed at the appropriate depth. Cover the seed lightly with soil. Water gently. Provide sunlight.
4. Model Answer/Key Points: Sun heats water on Earth's surface. Water turns into vapor and rises (evaporation). Vapor cools and forms tiny water droplets or ice crystals (condensation). These droplets/crystals clump together to form clouds. When clouds become too heavy, water falls back as rain (precipitation).
