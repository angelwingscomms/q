    "The ancient Iroko tree stood majestically in the village square. Its massive branches spread wide like a chief's welcoming embrace. Weaver birds built their intricate nests in its leaves, their cheerful chirps filling the air all day long. A small stream, 'Odo-Aro', flowed gently nearby, its water cool and clear.
