  "quiz": "Section A: COMPREHENSION\nTITLE: THE STONE CUTTER\nThere was once a stone cutter who was dissatisfied with himself and with his position in life. One day, he passed a wealthy trader’s house. Through the open gateway, he saw many fine cars and other possessions. He became very envious and wished he could be like the wealthy trader. To his great surprise, he suddenly became the trader. He enjoyed more luxuries and power than he ever imagined.\nSoon, a high official passed by, accompanied by attendants and escorted by soldiers. Everyone, no matter how rich, had to bow low to the official. ‘I wish that I could be a high official’, he thought.\nThen he became the high official, carried everywhere, but was feared and hated by the people all round. \nIt was a hot summer day, so the official felt very uncomfortable in the sticky sedan chair. He looked up at the sun. It shone proudly in the sky. ‘How powerful the sun is!’ he thought. ‘I wish that I could be the sun’.\nThen, he became the sun, shining down on everyone, burning the fields, cursed by the farmers and labourers. But a big cloud moved between him and the earth, so that his light could no longer shine on everything below. ‘How powerful that storm cloud is!’ he thought. ‘I wish that I could be a cloud!’\nThen, he became the cloud, flooding the fields and villages, shouted at by everyone. Soon he found that he was being pushed away by some great force – the wind. He thought, ‘I wish that I could be the wind!’\nThen, he became the wind, blowing tiles off the roofs of houses, and uprooting trees. He was feared and hated by all below him. \n‘How powerful that rock is!’ he thought, ‘I wish that I could be a rock!’. Then, he became the rock, more powerful than anything else on earth. But as he stood there, he heard the sound of a hammer pounding a chisel into the hard rock and he felt himself being changed. ‘What could be more powerful than me, the rock?’ he thought. He looked down and saw far below him the figure of a stone cutter. It is wise to be contented with one’s position in life.
